What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" *This statement summarizes the disparity between having a conceptual understanding of the dataset and applying that to an actual structure. We might know what we are trying to observe, but the data have to be structured properly to work with it well.*\n",
